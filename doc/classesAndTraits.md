## Case Classes and Traits

Parsing and serializing case classes is as easy as it gets with ScalaJack.  Serializing is simply a call to render():

```scala
case class Person(name:String, age:Int)
val sj = ScalaJack()
val js = sj.render(Person("Mike",32))
// renders {"name":"Mike","age":32}
```

All basic Scala primitive data types are support in addition to Java primitives and Java 8's java.time classes.  Collections are supported as well.  (Note: Java classes must conform to JavaBeans standards for getters/setters, i.e. ScalaJack presumes Java classes are JavaBeans.)

Of course you can nest collections and case classes as you like:

```scala
case class Hobby(desc:String, cost:Double)
case class Person(name:String, age:Int, hobbies:List[Hobby])
sj.render(Person("Mike",32,List(Hobby("surfing",1000.0))))
// renders {"name":"Mike","age":32,"hobbies":[{"desc":"surfing","cost":1000.0}]}
```

Parsing JSON into a case class is similarly easy, with the addition of a given type parameter to tell ScalaJack what kind of class you're trying to construct:

```scala
val js = """{"name":"Mike","age":32}"""
val person = sj.read[Person](js)
```

This works for collections too:

```scala
val js = """[
{"name":"Mike","age":32},
{"name":"Sarah","age":29}
]"""
val person = sj.read[List[Person]](js)

val js2 = """{
"surfers":[{"name":"Mike","age":32}]
}"""
val byHobby = sj.read[Map[String,List[Person]]](js)
```
So you can see the combinations can be as complex as you need.

### Traits

Traits work the same way but with the small addition of a type hint.  This is to tell ScalaJack what concrete class to construct from a given trait type.  Consider this example:

```scala
package com.me

trait Pet{ val name:String; val numLegs:Int }
case class Dog(name:String, numLegs:Int) extends Pet

val inst:Pet = Dog("Fido",4)

// Render as a case class
val jsDog = sj.render(inst)  // renders {"name":"Fido","numLegs":4}
sj.read[Dog](jsDog)

// Render as a trait
val jsPet = sj.render[Pet](inst) // renders {"_hint":"com.me.Dog","name":"Fido","numLegs":4}
sj.read[Pet](jsPet)

// Oops!
sj.read[Pet](jsDog) // Explodes, because there's no type hint, so ScalaJack doesn't know which Pet to make
```

OK, there's a few things going on here.  Let's work backwards.  Notice I can render my instance either as a case class (Dog) or a trait (Pet).  The trait rendering requires I provide the type of the trait, Pet, in the render() call, which tells ScalaJack to add a type hint field in the rendered output.  That's because you rendered a Pet, not a Dog.  Without the hint, ScalaJack has no idea that this Pet should, in fact, be a Dog when read back in, so we have to leave it a hint.

Reading a properly serialized trait back in is simple:
```scala
val js = """{"_hint":"com.me.Dog","name":"Fido","numLegs":4}"""
sj.read[Pet](js)
```
The given type hint will allow ScalaJack to construct a Dog object and return it as a Pet, which is what you want.

We'll see in a later section how you can customize both the type hint label and the value in your JSON.
